How it works?
1. Copy bundled scripts to one of Hadoop cluster node and unzip it.
2. Modify config.txt for required parameters to test. By default its Null means no components test.
3. Change permission to executable to all shell scripts.
4. Run verification_script.sh.
5. Check output in summary output in output.txt and details output in out.txt.

How to use?
1. Hadoop verification scripts can run directly on any node where hadoop components are isntalled.
2. Check config.txt file for required componets to be tested.
3. Once permissions i.e. "chmod 777 *.sh" set run "./verification_script.sh 2> out.txt"
4. Verify summary result of verification scripts in output.txt.
5. Verify detail output in case of any error in out.txt.
